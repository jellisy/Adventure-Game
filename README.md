# Text Based Adventure Game

A fun and simple version of the classic text based adventure game, written in Python. This project was written as part of the Intro to Programming Nanodegree Program with Udacity (2022).

# Description

The game is short by design, so to easily demonstrate understanding of the core concepts required for the project:
- The program outputs a description of the game setting, then stores input from the user.
- The program has different outcomes depending on the player's choices and random factors.
- The program includes functions, conditional statements, and input validation.
- The program does not crash.

# Instructions

To play this game, you must have python installed on your computer. Copy the file cool_game.py to your local machine, navigate to the directory in which it is saved, and open a terminal window. To run the program, enter `python cool_game.py` or `python3 cool_game.py`
